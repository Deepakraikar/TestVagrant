# TestVagrant

As per the problem statement,
1 .Test case to validate team should have only 4 foreign players and
2 .Team should have atlease 1 wicket keeper.

I have also taken the consideration common IPL rules and done the validation ,
such as
1.Total 11 players per team.
2 If only 4 foreign players then we need consider 7 reamining indian players in the playing squad.

Note : 
In the Json array they have used "price-in-crores" , In my java code it was not allowing me to take the value with "-" , so I changed the "price-in-crores" into "price".
